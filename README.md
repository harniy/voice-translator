# About the project

In this project, you can get a screenshot from a third-party site without going to it. All received images are independently deleted from the server after the client receives it.

## Getting Started with "git clone"

Copy the application to your PC and then install all dependencies using npm install

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Client side `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Server side `npm dev`

Runs the server on localhost: 7000 or process.env.PORT, if the server has appropriate settings
